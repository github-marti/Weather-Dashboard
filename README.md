# Weather-Dashboard

This Weather Dashboard shows the current weather for your local area by default, and also allows you to search for the city/town of your choice. Just type the name of a town into the search bar and hit the search button to get that town's local weather and ten-day forecast.

This app used the OpenWeatherMap API.
